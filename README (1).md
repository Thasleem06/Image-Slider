## Image Slider    
          An Image Slider is an animated WordPress design element used to display videos and images on a website. Like a slideshow, Image Sliders show one video or image at a time. The content changes when visitors click to see the next slide, or it changes automatically after a few seconds.


## Description
            The Image Slider project was designed to provide an interactive and responsive way to display a collection of images. The core functionality involves automatic image transitions along with manual navigation using previous and next buttons. This simple yet effective image slider can be integrated into websites to enhance user experience with a visually appealing way to showcase images.


## Features
Automatic Image Transition: Automatically cycles through images at set intervals.
Manual Navigation: Users can move to the next or previous image manually.
Responsive Layout: The slider adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
Smooth Transitions: CSS transitions for a visually appealing sliding effect between images.
Customizable: Easy to modify with different images, transition speeds, and timing.

  ## Acknowledgements
          We would like to express our gratitude to the following individuals and resources for their valuable contributions to this project,,
                 "Libraries and Tools"
jQuery:- A fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal, event handling, and animation. It was useful in handling the animations and DOM manipulation in some earlier versions of the slider.

CSS3 Animations and Transitions:-We used native CSS3 for the smooth transitions and animations in this project, which allowed for cleaner and more efficient code compared to using JavaScript for animations.

Font Awesome:-The icons for "Next" and "Previous" buttons (❮ and ❯) were inspired by the Font Awesome library, which provides a wide range of scalable vector icons.

## Lessons Learned
             During the development of this image slider, several key lessons were learned which helps to improve the component.... 
>>> Designing for different screen sizes posed a challenge. Ensuring the slider works well on both mobile and desktop devices required careful planning.
>>>Using CSS media queries and flexbox layouts helped achieve a fully responsive design.
>>>For a smooth experience, we initially overlooked image optimization. Large image sizes affected performance, especially on mobile devices.
>>> Initially, inconsistent image sizes caused the slider to break or display awkwardly.
>>>Implementing the auto-slide feature required proper timing and control. The challenge was ensuring that the slider didn’t transition too quickly or too slowly.
>>>Adding keyboard navigation (prev/next arrows) and improving button focus states made the slider more accessible to users with different needs.
>>>Ensuring that the slider worked across all modern browsers was important. While most browsers supported the basic functionality, slight differences in how browsers handle CSS transitions required some tweaking, especially for older versions of Internet Explorer.
